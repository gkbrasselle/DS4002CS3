# DS4002Project3

## Section 1: Software and platform section

This project was completed using Mac and Windows platforms. The coding language used was Python and the coding environment used was Google Colab. The face-recognition package in Python was used, for which documentation can be accessed here: https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/

## Section 2: Map of Documentation
### This repository is organized as follows:
1. DATA
    - celeb_image_data.csv --> final dataset used for analysis 
      
2. SCRIPTS
    - step1_testing.ipynb --> 
    - step2_EDA.ipynb --> script containing the intial exploratory data analysis plots

4. OUTPUT

      
5. LICENSE
6. README.md
  
## Section 3: Instructions for reproducing results

### Please follow these steps in order to replicate this project's experimental design:

1. Download celebrity images on Google, separating them into folders by celebrity name, such as "Margot-Robbie" or "Will-Smith." Ensure that each folder contains 100 celebrity images, labelled 01-100. Alternatively, use the image folders pre-collected in the "celebrities" folder for ease of replication.
2. Navigate to the "step1_testing.ipynb" in the "SCRIPTS" folder. Install the necessary libraries / dependencies to run the code (listed at the top of the file).
3. Next, open the "step2_EDA.ipynb" in the "SCRIPTS" folder to create some visuals. This will help better understand the variables used in the dataset.
